fzf+fasd
========

A shell plugin that integrates [fzf] and [fasd] --- tab completion of `z` with fzf's fuzzy search!

Currently supports zsh only (TODO: bash), and the `z` command (TODO: `d,` and `f,`)


Usage
-----

```
z [dir name slug]<TAB>
```


Installation
------------

Make sure that you have [fzf] and [fasd] installed.
